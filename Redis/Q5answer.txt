Multiprocessing :
    Multiprocess is a technique where parallelism can be achieved . With multiprocessing each task is taken by a seperate a process across multiple cpu cores. It takes seperate memory for task. This is suitable for cpu related tasks


Multithreading:
    TO do different task multiple threads can be created so that it is spawned by process
    as different task on single core .Each threads run in concurrent manner.Memory space is shared by thread .Suitable for I/o task


GIL:
    Global Interpreter Lock
    In python programs are mostly single-thread and use one cpu ,so this applies an lock over the interpreter and allows only one thread to hold the interpreter 
    This doesnt facilitates multiprocessing automatically since multiple process would be running across multiple cpu and if the interpreter is locked by single process the entire point of multi process is a failure. 
    
    To over come this and to implement multiprocessing, each process is given with seperate GIL and instance of interpreter
