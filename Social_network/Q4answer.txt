How to scale the api and secure it?
    The traffic should be handled properly by using the load balancers and the api failovers should be handled. Ability to handle variety of request is an added advantage for scaling .
    The rate limiter for an api can help to decrease the loads

    We can scale the the api horizontally as it would incur more server and reduces the loads.For better performance we can cache and queue 
    
    The api can be secured using credentials authtokens which authorizes the user into the application these auth token serves the data required . On top we can secure the api with setting a particular session to minimal time ie . setting the token to expire within minimal period of time
